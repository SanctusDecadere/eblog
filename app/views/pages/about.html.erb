				Hey all! I've been in the service industry pretty much my entire working life. I worked at the same bar for 12 wonderful years. I grew up there and would consider the staff as well as some customers a part of my extended family. As difficult as it was to pack up and leave my job and childhood neighborhood I felt it was the right decision and hope it pays off.

				I moved to Massachusetts on February 20th and have been studying intently on my own in hopes of entering the tech industry as a Front-End Developer. The journey so far has been both extremely exciting and arduous. I wouldn't have it any other way. Wish me luck!

				Some random things about me! My nickname as a kid was boobie. Nothing to do with breasts though one would assume. I'm 5' 11" but lie and say I'm 6' to save syllables. I like fiddling around with my keyboard but wouldn't say I play. I fiddle. Magic the Gathering anyone? I love the game and am always excited to meet other players as I don't get to play that often anymore. I enjoy harsh languages and am a fan of Russian and German. I've tried learning them off and on over the years on duolingo and books. Es ist sehr schwer. Aber Spa√ü! Sushi. I eat it a lot. Thats all for now!
